# Project-Pixel-Art-Maker

This application gets input from the user for height,width and cell color and then uses these inputs to create a grid with the specified height and width. The user can left click to color a grid cell with the selected color or it can click and move the cursor across the grid to color multiple grid cells. Right clicking a cell removes the applied color and make the cell of color white.
